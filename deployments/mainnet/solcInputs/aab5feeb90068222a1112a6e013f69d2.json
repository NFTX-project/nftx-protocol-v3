Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n * constructor() {\n *     _disableInitializers();\n * }\n * ```\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract Initializable {\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\n     */\n    uint8 private _initialized;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initializing;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\n     */\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.
